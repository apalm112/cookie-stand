Cookie Stand Project for Week 2

Worked with Dan to build the table & populate it with store data.

Worked with Brandon & Ivar to add a form to the site in order to enter new store data.

Working on the style guide, a web page for Pat's customers & the CSS file for it.  Added images & animation to css.

Changed the JS & HTML files to properly build & display the table.
